I'm Anamaria, a PhD student in bioinformatics by day, and by night, too, sometimes. I'm from Croatia, living in Barcelona - and I love Barcelona. I also love traveling, and taking photos, and taking photos when traveling - even though I don't really like planning trips, because that doesn't go well with my hobbies, which are overthinking and procrastinating.  
And I like dogs more than I like most people.
