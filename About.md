<b>If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is what do I do, what are my professional interests and skills, perhaps which degree do I hold and maybe even what are my most significant achievements, and all that important introductory stuff, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.</b>

I studied biology for a while. Then I learned something about computers. Eventually, I came across the mythical fields of data science and artificial intelligence, which I learned were nothing but applied statistics, and variations of statistical learning on steroids, respectively. And now everyday I'm learning something new while trying to thread along the intersection of all those topics. Now, just _imagine_ the impostor syndrome! :)  

I started writing this blog because I found myself recurringly encountering certain problems, and each time scraping together pieces of a solution from three forums and two mailing lists. Instead, now I try to formulate each said solution in a neat blog post, which helps me and might at some point even prove usefull to someone else. Once in a while, more often than not, I'll also write a post with no particular purpose, other than that I found it entertaining to write. But you know what they say, about time you enjoy wasting not being wasted.  

I'll finish this brief account with a recursion. To quote Ocar Wilde, quotation is a serviceable substitute for wit, so here's a pseudo-randomly chosen item from my rather small sample of witty messages, remarks, punchlines and comebacks:
