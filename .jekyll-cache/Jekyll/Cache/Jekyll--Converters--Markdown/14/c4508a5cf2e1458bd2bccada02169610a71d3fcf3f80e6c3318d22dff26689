I"|<p>Peñíscola, a cozy town in province of Castellón, Valencia.
Two hours train ride away from Barcelona, it is quite popular - mostly among Spanish tourist, it would seem, because we didn;t hear a single person speaking English during the three days we spent there. It could be because of Covid, however. Town’s most iconic features are the long sandy beach and the historic castle that used to be home of the templars, and later of an illegitimate pope. Quite a few htels, restaurants and streets here are named after Papa Luna, so I imagine he was not such negative personality as his failed papal aspirations might suggest.</p>
