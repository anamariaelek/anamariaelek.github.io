I"¬<p>Iâ€™m Anamaria, a PhD student in bioinformatics by day, and by night, too, sometimes. Iâ€™m from Croatia, living in Barcelona - and I love Barcelona. I also love traveling, and taking photos, and taking photos when traveling - even though I donâ€™t really like planning trips, because that doesnâ€™t go well with my hobbies, which are overthinking and procrastinating.<br />
And I like dogs more than I like most people.</p>
