I"Q<p>Girona is a mere 1 hour ride away from Barcelona, yet it took me more than one and a half year to go there. With itâ€™s colorful riverfront, picturesque old town, and the grand cathedral (no, I am not a Game of Thrones fan, but I still know about the cathedral featuring in the series) - it is definitely a day trip worth making.</p>
