I"†<p>PeÃ±Ã­scola, a cozy town in province of CastellÃ³n, Valencia.<br />
Two hours train ride away from Barcelona, it is quite popular - mostly among Spanish tourists, it would seem, because we didnâ€™t hear a single person speaking English during the three days we spent there. It could be because of COVID, however.<br />
This townâ€™s most iconic features are the long sandy beach and the historic castle that used to be home of the templars, and later of an illegitimate pope. Quite a few hotels, restaurants and streets here are named after Papa Luna, so I imagine he was not such negative personality as his failed papal aspirations might suggest.<br />
Also worth checking out is the nearby natural park La Sierra de Irta, a nice place to combine hiking and swimming - even though one probably shouldnâ€™t do it at noon, as we did.<br />
And you couldnâ€™t miss paella even if you wanted too.</p>
